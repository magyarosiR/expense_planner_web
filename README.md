# expense_planner_website
 
I designed this project in HTML, CSS & JavaScript for web. In this website the user can add cards for incomes and expenses and the site will calculate a monthly summary, income and expense budget. I designed a flexible
responsive layout structure with Flexible Box Layout Module and I've gained insight how the Bootstrap library works. I've used Bootstrap classes in my footer icons. I paid special attention for UX.

This project is under development.
